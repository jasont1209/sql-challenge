# sql-challenge
 
used quickdbd to set up ERD and export into postgres sql file as base for schema script.
used script: "ALTER DATABASE "sql-challenge" SET datestyle TO "ISO, MDY";" on database as suggested by Pooja Niranjan who received support from BCS to help resolve errors in importing employee dataset due to problems with the date.
